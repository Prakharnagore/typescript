# Typescript Overview

Typescript = Javascript + A type system

- catch error during development
- uses type annotations to analyze our code
- only active during development
- doesn't provide any performance optimization

Typescript code (Javascript with type annotations) -> Typescript complier -> Plain old javascript

- Typescript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or node
