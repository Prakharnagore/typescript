# Classes

- Blueprint to create an object with some fields(values) and methods (functions) to represent a 'thing'

# Modifiers

Modifiers are keyword that we place on different methods and properties inside of a class.

- public
  This method can we called any where, any time
- private
  This methods can only be called by other methods in this class
- protected
