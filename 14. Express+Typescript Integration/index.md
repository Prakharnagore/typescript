# Typescript

- Typescript has a distint OOP style
- Many popular JS libs were written before JS had any solid idea of 'classes'
- Integrating TS with popular JS libs can be tough

# TS with JS Libs

- Use the lib normally, adding in basic type annotations where possible
- Use a TS adapter library that has helpers for using your lib with TS
  npm i ts-express-decorators
- Twist your lib to work with TS classes

# OOPs

- JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language. But it still has ways
  of using object oriented programming (OOP).
- JavaScript is a prototype-based object-oriented language as it has no classes
  like other object-oriented languages
- True OOP languages do not perform prototyping in the background.
- Classes in javascript are 'syntactic sugar' over prototypal inheritance.
