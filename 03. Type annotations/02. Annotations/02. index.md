# Type inference

If the declaration and initialization are on the same line, typescript will figure out the type of 'color' for us

# Type annotations

When to use

- When we declare a vairable on one line then initalize it later.
- When we want a variable a to have a type that can't be inferred.
- When a function returns the 'any' type and we need to clariy the value.

# Why JSON.parse() has any type

Typescript has no idea what JSON.parse will return so it return any type

'false' -> JSON.parse() -> should return boolean -> any
'4' -> JSON.parse() -> should return number -> any
'{"value":5}' -> JSON.parse() -> should return {value:number} -> any
'{"name":'alex'}' -> JSON.parse() -> should return {name:string} -> any

# any type

Ts has no idea what this is - can't check for correct property references

Note: Avoid variables with 'any' at all costs
