# Typed Array

- Array where each element is some consistent type of value

# Why typed arrays ?

- TS can do type inference when extracting values
- TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values
- We can get help with "map", "forEach", "reduce" functions
- Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types

# When to use typed arrays

- Any time we need to represent a collection of records with some arbitrary sort order.
